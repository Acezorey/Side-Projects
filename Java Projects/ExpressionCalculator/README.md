This is a work-in-progress infix calculator designed to read inputted expressions, and calculate the result of them.

This calculator will be designed to handle all positive and negative digits, as well as the operators +, -, /, *, ^, and %. Once 
calculated, this calculator will be able to output the correct value of any expression given that they do not exceed the 64-bit integer limit.

It will also have a memory system, with the capitalized character "A" denoting the result of the previous input.

Once again this project is still in progress. For now, it has a system to read user inputs and a system to verify if that input is a legitimate mathematical 
expression.

Created, tested, and intended to be used with Eclipse IDE, an IDE development environment for Java developers.

Completed:
- User input reading system
- Input verification system

To Do:
- Calculative system
